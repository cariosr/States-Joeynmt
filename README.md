# States-Joeynmt
Prior work, with the aim of extracting the hidden states from LSTM joey model. Then to used on the DQN approach. 

# TODO:
* It is not learning... debugg it. 
* Check the rewards per step. Try others scores...  
* Select the higgest rewards on sampling. 
* Incorporate the final step of the algorith, the update of the seq2seq model.
